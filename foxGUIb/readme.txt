==========================

== What is foxGUIb? ==
foxGUIb is a GUI creator and code generator for FXRuby. It's a
convenient tool that makes it easy to quickly build complex and
good looking graphical user interfaces for Ruby.

== Who should care? ==
* FXRuby newbies who want to experiment with the widgets and layouts.
* FXRuby experts who want to prototype parts of their GUI components rapidly.
... ok, lets say everyone who wants to create GUI with FXRuby ;)

== What has changed? ==
Fixed a few minor bugs and finally incremented version to 1.0.0 after all.
foxGUIb can be considered pretty stable.
